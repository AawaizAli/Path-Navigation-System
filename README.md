Karachi City Path Navigation
Welcome to Karachi City Path Navigation, a graphical user interface (GUI) based application designed to navigate paths within the city of Karachi. This program offers two main functionalities: pathfinding using Dijkstra's Algorithm and generating a minimum spanning tree using Prim's Algorithm.

Features
Dijkstra's Algorithm
All Paths: Find the shortest paths from a selected starting point to all other locations within Karachi.
Specific Paths: Determine the shortest path between two specific locations within the city.
Prim's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
Generate the minimum spanning tree for the city, highlighting the essential connections between various locations.
Installation
To run this program locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/karachi-city-navigation.git
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Install necessary libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Program
Execute the main file:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Select Algorithm
Choose between Dijkstra's Algorithm or Prim's Algorithm from the program interface.

Dijkstra's Algorithm

For finding all paths: Select "All Paths" and choose a starting point.
For specific paths: Select "Specific Paths" and input the start and end locations.
Prim's Algorithm
Select "Minimum Spanning Tree" to generate the minimum spanning tree for Karachi.

View Results
The program will display the paths or the minimum spanning tree graphically on the GUI.
