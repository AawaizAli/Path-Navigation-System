# Karachi City Path Navigation
Welcome to the Karachi City Navigation application, a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) designed for seamless path navigation within the dynamic city of Karachi. This application is equipped with two powerful functionalities: pathfinding using Dijkstra's Algorithm and the generation of a minimum spanning tree using Prim's Algorithm.

## Features
### Dijkstra's Algorithm
1. All Paths: Discover the shortest paths from a chosen starting point to all other locations within Karachi.
1. Specific Paths: Identify the shortest route between two specified locations within the city.
### Prim's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
Generate a minimum spanning tree for the city, emphasizing vital connections between diverse locations.
## Installation
To run the application locally, follow these steps:
### Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/karachi-city-navigation.git
```
### Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Install necessary libraries using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the Program
Execute the main file:
```
python main.py
```
## Usage
Choose the Algorithm
Select either Dijkstra's Algorithm or Prim's Algorithm from the user-friendly interface.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

- For discovering all paths: Choose "All Paths" and specify a starting point.
- For specific paths: Select "Specific Paths" and input the start and end locations.
### Prim's Algorithm
Choose "Minimum Spanning Tree" to generate a visual representation of the minimum spanning tree for Karachi.

## View Results
The application will elegantly display the paths or the minimum spanning tree graphically on the intuitive GUI.
